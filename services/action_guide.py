"""
"What do I do now?" guide for AirBnBrrr alerts, in plain language.

Turns the rule-engine findings (and what the per-AC model found odd) into a short, ordered action
plan: how urgent it is, the first thing to do, what to check, and when to call a technician. The
plan is saved inside the alert (diagnoses -> action_plan), shown on the alert page, and the top
steps go in the ntfy notification.

No limit numbers are written here: the numbers come from the finding itself, which uses the limits
of that AC. General guidance for a window-type AC; electrical or refrigerant work needs a technician.
