"""
Independent alert channels for AirBnBrrr (v3.0).

Every incoming reading is judged by THREE separate channels. They share nothing: each has its own
detection, its own timers and its own message, so one channel can never delay, replace or suppress
another.

    ml      The trained per-AC model (Isolation Forest + distance-to-normal) says the reading is not how
            THIS AC normally behaves. Works even when every reading is inside the safety limits.
            Never touched by the Safety Limit Alerts switch. With no usable model it stays silent:
            a threshold is never presented as an ML result.
    safety  Predefined safety limits (the per-AC limits on the Manage ACs page). Can be switched off with
            "Safety Limit Alerts". Current / voltage / power over the limit alert at once; every other limit
            must still be a problem 3 minutes later. High humidity is NOT a limit any more (low humidity is).
    sensor  A sensor that did not answer (offline). It is a device problem, not a threshold and not an ML
            result, so neither switch affects it.

This file has no web or database code, so the whole decision can be tested with real model results.
